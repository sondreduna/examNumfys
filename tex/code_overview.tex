The source code for this project is structured into separate files for each sub-problem, i.e. \lstinline|prob_2A.py|, \lstinline|prob_2B.py| etc. Additionally, there is a file for plotting for each sub-problem. I have also included a file called \lstinline|utils.py| which contains some useful utility functions used throughout the exercises. For problem $2$A I have used the same ODE-solver as the one I made for exercise $2$. This can be found in \lstinline|ode.py|.
